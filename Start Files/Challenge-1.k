 * ---------------------------
 Suppose that Karel has settled into its house. Karel starts off in the
 northwest corner of its house as shown in the diagram. The problem is to
 program Karel to collect the newspaper—represented by a beeper—from
 outside the doorway and then to return to its initial position.

This exercise is extremely simple and is intended mostly to get you started.
You can assume that every part of the world looks just as it does in the
diagram. The house is exactly this size, the door is always in the position
shown, and the beeper is just outside the door. Thus, all you have to do is
write the sequence of statements necessary to have Karel
perform the following tasks:

1. Move to the newspaper.
2. Pick it up.
3. Return to Karel’s original starting point.

Even though the program requires just a few lines, it is still worth
getting at least a little practice in decomposition. In your solution,
decompose the program so that it includes a function for each step
shown in the outline.
